# Printf Project

Printf is a ALX software engineering team project aimed at implementing a simplified version of the `printf` function. The goal is to produce output according to a format string and handle various conversion specifiers.

## Introduction

The `printf` function is a widely used C library function that prints formatted text. The Custom Printf project aims to create a custom version of `printf` that adheres to specific requirements and tasks outlined in the project description.

## Project Tasks

The project is divided into several tasks, each focusing on different aspects of the custom `printf` implementation. Here are the tasks we've worked on:

### Task 0

- Implement a basic version of `printf` that handles conversion specifiers `c`, `s`, and `%`.
- Output the results to the standard output stream.
- Do not handle flag characters, field width, precision, or length modifiers.

### Task 1

- Extend the functionality to handle conversion specifiers `d` and `i`.

### Task 2

- Introduce a custom conversion specifier, `b`, which converts an unsigned int argument to binary.

### Task 3

- Handle conversion specifiers `u`, `o`, `x`, and `X`.
- Similar to Task 0, no need to handle flag characters, field width, precision, or length modifiers.

### Task 4

- Optimize the code by using a local buffer to minimize calls to the `write` function.

### Task 5

- Introduce the custom conversion specifier `S`, which prints strings.
- Non-printable characters are displayed as `\x`, followed by their ASCII code in hexadecimal (always 2 characters).

### Task 6

- Handle the conversion specifier `p`.

### Task 7

- Implement the flag characters `+`, `space`, and `#` for non-custom conversion specifiers.

### Task 8

- Handle the length modifiers `l` and `h` for non-custom conversion specifiers.

### Task 9

- Implement the field width for non-custom conversion specifiers.

### Task 10

- Handle the precision for non-custom conversion specifiers.

### Task 11

- Implement the `0` flag character for non-custom conversion specifiers.

### Task 12

- Handle the `-` flag character for non-custom conversion specifiers.

### Task 13

- Introduce the custom conversion specifier `r`, which prints reversed strings.

### Task 14

- Introduce the custom conversion specifier `R`, which prints rot13'ed strings.

### Task 15

- Ensure that all the options and tasks work together harmoniously.
